     <h1>A ordered list example</h1>
     <div></div>
    	 <header>My preparation list for application to university:</header>
    	 <ul>
    		<li>1. TOEFL test</li>
    		<li>2. SAT</li>
    		<li>3.Enrollment test
    		    <ul>
    		    	<li>1. Japanese</li>
    		    	<li>2. Mathmatics</li>
    		    	<li>3. English</li>
    		    	<li>4. physics</li>
    		    	<li>5. chemistry </li>
    		    </ul>
    		</li>
    		<li>4.GPA</li>
    	</ul>
     <p>The instance above reveals that the command "ul" is used to incite a list, and of course "/ul" is used to end this list, and each "li" represents one particular content in the list. Though, when we want to set a child list, we view the child list as a content in the original list, do the same thing as mentioned above, and finally enclose the whole content with "/li", as can be showcased in the instance 3, Enrollment test. 
     Be aware that when we want to compile a semantic tag to explain something in the list, we should let it enclosed by "li"and "/li".</p>
