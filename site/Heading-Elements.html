     <h1>We usually use HEADING ELEMENTS as a title or passage in the website. We have "h+(number)" commands to write the heading, and we have a increasing sequence of numbers after the letter h representing the decreasing size of each words.</h1>
     <p>Now, we can view it explicitly:</p>
     <h1>***h1:This is the main heading***</h1>
     <h2>***h2:Subheading 2***</h2>
     <h3>***h3:Subheading 3***</h3>
     <h4>***h4:Subheading 4***</h4>
     <h5>***h5:Subheading 5***</h5>
     <h6>***h6:Subheading 6***</h6>
