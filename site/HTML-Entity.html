 <p>P1:EXAMPLE here <then we kill each other> to provide you a method to write <getting obesity & not well> words cannot be intepreted by html.</p>
 <p>Then we look at the way we replace special notation in html.</p>
 <p>P2:EXAMPLE here &lt;then we kill each other&gt; to provide you a method to write &lt;getting obesity&amp;not well&gt; words cannot be intepreted by html.</p>
 <p>We can see obviously that there are additional contents in P2 which do not appear in P1.</p>

 <h3>Comparing two examples, we can conclude that there is a command enabling adjacent words (release and exhibition) to stick to each other.</h3>
