	<p class="element-drived-class-selector"> "#" and "." represent a <span class="class-selector">specific sort</span> of modification to designated passages, and "#" is the form of id selector, while "." is the form of class selector. Though, we can add a particular semantic tag with a comma in the front of those to restrict this kind of style to be applied in the message enclosed by that tags.
