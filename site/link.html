	<h1>Internal Links</h1>
	<section>
		We can link to a file in the same directory as this HTML like this:
		<a href="list.html" >***"a": Linking to a file in the same directory as this file.(list.html)</a>
		<a href="list.html">
			<div>DIV linking to a file in the same directory(list.html)</div>
		</a>
		<p>Now, we learn that when we use command "a" and "href" only, we can target links to a file in the same directory as this file, which are called internal links.</p>
	</section>
	<h1>External links</h1>
	<section>
		We can link to a designated website via this file like this:
		<a href="http://www.bilibili.com/" target="_blank" title="Like This Page!">A link to bilibili.</a>
		<p>We copy a specific address of a website and paste it after the "href" command to create a hyperlink to that website. Besides, the command "target" is use to create a new browser in case of the moment we still have something to do with present browser. By the way, "target" should be enclosed by &lt;a&gt;.</p>
