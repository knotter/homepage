	<title>div and span elements: experiment</title>

	<h1>Basic Elements: </h1>
	<h1>DIV stands for a block level element;</h1>
	<h1>Span represents a inline element.</h1>
	<h1>Now, let's see how it work.</h1>
	<div>*** DIV 1: Some content here ***</div>
	<div>*** DIV 2: Following right after div 1 ***</div>
	We can see that two contents are divided into two levels
	<div>
	     <span>*** Span 1: some content here ***</span>
	     <span>*** Span 2: following tight after span 1 ***</span>
	<p>We can view explicitly the definition of command "div" as well as "span". However, we have another version of </p>
	<div>*** DIV 1: Some content here ***</div>
	<div>*** DIV 2: Following right after div 1 ***</div>
	<span>*** Span 1: some content here ***</span>
	<span>*** Span 2: following tight after span 1 ***</span>
	<p>Apparently, we can use div command without a break to seperate two sentence.</p>
	<h1>Tips: Div command or Span command is not a child command of each other.</h1>
