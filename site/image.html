	<img src="https://www.myenglishpages.com/images/voc/reading/easter-eggs.jpg" width="600" height="400">
	<p>We can see that we succeed in inserting a image in the page via the command "img" with "src". When we want to adjust the size of this image, we have commands "width" and "height".</p>
	<div>Let's view another example:</div>
	<img src="summer pocket.jpg" width="499" height="312" alt="Picture with a quote"> &quot;it is from a game summer pocket.&quot;
	<p>from this we can view that when we use "alt", an description can be added.</p>
